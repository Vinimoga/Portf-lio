Hi, my name is Vinicius Motta Garcia, or Vinimoga,
and i'm trying to create a type of horror game 
in the molds of Wolfenstein 3D.

This game will be a kind of sense Horror, 
you will be deprived of your senses but something
lurking in the shadows will not.

The concepts I'll use (the ones I remember) are
object collision, raycasting, pseudo 3D, etc.
