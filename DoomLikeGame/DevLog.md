0919 - Today I've started venturing out about the 
raycast functions. They are a bit complicated but 
I'm trying to figure it out. I'have found another
but with me FAKEWIDTH and FAKEHEIGHT, becouse
they weren't in all the player assets, only on 
the map ones, it made the player be shown in 
another location but their coordinates be in 
another tile. After putting all the values on the 
player, it worked flawlessly, but I really had to 
figure It out. It has been an adventure until now,
I expect that this project takes some time before 
I really say it is 'finished'. I'm not thinking in
making a pretty big game, only something I cass 
take some time off college and into programming.

0927 - Started doing the engine of the game
(raycasting and stuff), it's been one week since I
did something in the game, better do more.
