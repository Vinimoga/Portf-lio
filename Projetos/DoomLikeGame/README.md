Hi, my name is Vinicius Motta Garcia, or Vinimoga,
and i'm trying to create a type of game 
in the molds of Wolfenstein 3D or DOOM.

This game will be in a kind of sense Horror, 
where you will be deprived of your senses but 
something lurking in the shadows will not.

The game is composted by a maze-like structure,
in this complex you need to find your way out 
of it with only a hint to where you should go, 
but be careful, It appears to have something 
following you, and if you can hear It, It for 
sure can hear you.


The concepts I'll use (the ones I remember) are
object collision, ray-casting, pseudo 3D, object
rendering, AI, etc.
